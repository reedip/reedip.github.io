Tap-as-a-Service is an OpenStack project designed to give tenants and service providers a safe and reliable means of monitoring the traffic flowing in their Neutron provisioned virtual networks, via the attachment of virtual taps that do not require any modifications to their instances. Following a short overview of the project, this presentation will explain the TaaS service-plugin and TaaS agent/driver designs and show how they facilitate the implementation of vendor and platform specific extensions. Recent enhancements to the API for supporting asynchronous behavior will also be covered. A discussion on the need for isolating production and mirrored traffic in the physical (underlay) network will follow, during which we will outline the techniques we are pursuing to realize this. We will conclude with a performance analysis of TaaS using different operating modes, platforms and workloads.
