Tap-as-a-Service is a relatively new OpenStack project that was designed to provide tenants and service providers a means of monitoring the traffic flowing in their Neutron provisioned virtual networks. A lot of work has been carried out in the last two cycles, with multiple developers from around the world now contributing to the cause.

This presentation offers a review of all the progress made to date. We will discuss the primary motivations for monitoring network activity, explore the major challenges one can expect to encounter when attempting to monitor network traffic in a cloud environment and describe the need for a platform oriented solution. Next, an overview of the TaaS architecture and API will be presented, along with an update on current development activities and some of the planned enhancements for the future. We will also demonstrate traffic visibility solutions for a representative set of use cases covering network trouble-shooting, security and analytics.
